Tao Te Ching 
Chapter One 
Tao (The Way) that can be spoken of is not the Cons
tant Tao’ 
The name that can be named is not a Constant Name. 
Nameless, is the origin of Heaven and Earth; 
The named is the Mother of all things. 
Thus, the constant void enables one to observe the 
true essence. 
The constant being enables one to see the outward m
anifestations. 
These two come paired from the same origin. 
But when the essence is manifested, 
It has a different name. 
This same origin is called “The Profound Mystery.” 
As profound the mystery as It can be, 
It is the Gate to the essence of all life. 
Chapter Two 
As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautifu
l, it becomes ugly. 
As soon as virtue is being known as something good,
 it becomes evil. 
Therefore being and non-being give birth to each ot
her. 
Difficult and easy accomplish each other. 
Long and short form each other. 
High and low distinguish each other. 
Sound and tone harmonize each other 
Before and after follow each other as a sequence. 
Realizing this, the saint performs effortlessly acc
ording to the natural Way without personal 
desire, and practices the wordless teaching thru on
e’s deeds. 
The saint inspires the vitality of all lives, witho
ut holding back. 
He nurtures all beings with no wish to take possess
ion of. 
He devotes all his energy but has no intention to h
old on to the merit. 
When success is achieved, he seeks no recognition. 
Because he does not claim for the credit, hence sha
ll not lose it. 
Chapter Three 
By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall int
o dispute. 
By not valuing the hard to get objects, people will
 not become robbers. 
By not seeing the desires of lust, one’s heart will
 not be confused. 
Therefore the governing of the saint is to empty on
e’s mind, substantiate one’s virtue, weaken 
one’s worldly ambition and strengthen one’s essence
. 
He lets the people to be innocent of worldly knowle
dge and desire, and keeps the clever ones 
from making trouble with their wits. 
Acts naturally without desire, then everything will
 be accomplished in its natural order. 
Chapter Four 
Tao (The Way) can be infused into the nature and pu
t to use without being exhausted. 
It is so deep and subtle like an abyss that is the 
origin of all things. 
It is complete and perfect as a wholeness that can 
Round off sharp edges; 
Resolve confusion; 
Harmonize with the glory; 
Act in unity with the lowliness. 
Tao is so profound and yet in invisible, It exists 
in everywhere and anywhere. 
I don not know whose Son It is, It existed before h
eaven and earth. 
Chapter Five 
Nature nurtures all things with the wholeness of co
mplete virtue. 
It shows the greatest and perfect kindness by givin
g life to let all things grow and accomplish 
them with the hastening of harvest. 
Therefore, according to ancient custom, nature may 
seem unkind to regard all beings as a 
traditional straw dog for sacrifice. 
And likewise with a saint, he may seem unkind to re
gard people as a traditional straw dog for 
sacrifice. 
The space between heaven and earth is like the bell
ows, it appears empty yet it gives a supply 
that never fails; 
The more it moves, the more it brings forth. 
Many words lead to exhaustion. 
It is better to center on the true essence within. 
Chapter Six 
Spirit of the valley is immortal. 
It is called the mystic nature. 
The gate o f the mystic nature is regarded as the r
oot of the universe. 
It is everlasting and cannot be consumed. 
Chapter Seven 
Heaven is everlasting and earth is enduring. 
The reason that they are everlasting is because the
y do not exist for themselves. 
Hence, they are long lived. 
Thus, although the saint puts himself last, finds h
imself in the lead. 
Although he is not self-concerned, finds himself ac
complished. 
It is because he is not focused on self-interests a
nd hence can fulfill his true nature. 
Chapter Eight 
A person of great virtue is like the flowing water.
Water benefits all things and contends not with the
m. 
It puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be 
and thus is closest to Tao. 
A virtuous person is like water which adapts itself
 to the perfect place. 
His mind is like the deep water that is calm and pe
aceful. 
His heart is kind like water that benefits all. 
His words are sincere like the constant flow of wat
er. 
His governing is natural without desire which is li
ke the softness of water that penetrates through 
hard rocks. 
His work is of talent like the free flow of water. 
His movement is of right timing like water that flo
ws smoothly. 
A virtuous person never forces his way and hence wi
ll not make faults. 
Chapter Nine 
Those who overly pride wealth is like the overflowi
ng water which shall cause damages. It is 
better to restrain early. 
Those who are not content with fame is like polishi
ng the edge of a knife. 
The sharper it gets, the easier it is to break. 
Wealth and treasures are but illusions that one can
not possess. 
Those who are arrogant of their wealth and fame sha
ll invite blame upon oneself. 
The nature Tao teaches one to retreat after one’s s
uccess and not to hold on to the credit. 
Chapter Ten 
Can one unite the body and the spirit as one and em
brace the “Oneness” without departing from 
the great Tao? 
Can one achieve harmony with such gentleness by hol
ding on to the true spirit within as if the 
innocence of an infant? 
Can one free oneself from worldly knowledge and cle
anse one’s mind, so that no faults shall be 
made? 
Can a ruler love his people by governing with the n
atural Way without personal intention? 
Can the mystic gate to all life essence be opened o
r closed without the virtue of the mysterious 
nature? 
Can one gain the insight of nature and become a wis
e person without the effort of action? 
The mysterious nature creates and nurtures all thin
gs without the desire to possess them. 
It performs with all efforts without claiming for c
redit. 
It flourishes all beings without the intention to t
ake control of. 
Such is the “Mystic Te” or “Mystic Virtue.” 
Chapter Eleven 
Thirty spokes unite around one hub to make a wheel.
It is the presence of the empty space that gives th
e function of a vehicle. 
Clay is molded into a vessel. It is the empty space
 that gives the function of a vessel. 
Doors and windows are chisel out to make a room. 
It is the empty space in the room that gives its fu
nction. 
Therefore, something substantial can be beneficial.
While the emptiness of void is what can be utilized
. 
Chapter Twelve 
The five colors can blind one’s eyes. 
The five tones can deafen one’s ears. 
The five flavors can dull one’s taste buds. 
The pursuit of pleasures can derange one’s mind. 
The hard-to-get valuables can distort one’s behavio
r. 
Therefore, a saint cultivates himself with virtues 
and does not indulge himself in sensory 
pleasures. 
He rejects those outer temptations and chooses this
 True Nature. 
Chapter Thirteen 
Honor and disgrace can surprise a person. 
The greatest distress lies in one’s physical body. 
What does it men by “Honor and disgrace can surpris
e someone?” 
Honor is inferior, because one who wins the favor i
s afraid of losing it. 
And one who loses the favor is frightened with dist
ress. 
This is the significance of “Honor and disgrace can
 surprise someone.” 
What does it mean by “The greatest distress lies in
 one’s body?” 
We have fear because we worry about our physical se
lf. 
If one’s body does not exist, how can one has fear?
Therefore, he who values the world as much as he va
lues himself, can be entrusted with the 
ruling of the world. 
He who loves the world as much as he loves himself,
 can be entrusted with the guidance of the 
world. 
Chapter Fourteen 
What cannot be seen is called the invisible. 
What cannot be heard is called the inaudible.
